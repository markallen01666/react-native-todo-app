# react-native-todo-app
A simple todo mobile app built using React Native 

I built this app as an exercise while learning React Native. The app was built using Expo and Android SDK emulators. I plan to use this app as the basis for another app for creating a shopping list. The next app will add greater functionality and modals on top of the basic functionality established in this app.


Shopping list app is in https://github.com/markallen01666/react-native-shopping-list
